# Barcode Checksum Calculator

This is my project for CS 313 Information Assurance and Security. 

The Barcode Checksum Calculator is a Python application built with PySide6 for calculating the check digit of a given barcode input. This tool calculates the checksum based on the odd and even positioned digits in the barcode, following standard checksum algorithms for barcodes.

## Features
- Input barcode digits through a graphical interface.
- Calculate the checksum of the barcode for validation purposes.
- Delete or clear inputs as needed.

## Installation
1. Download the executable:
- Go to the release page: [Barcode Checksum Calculator](https://github.com/brynyz/Barcode-Checksum-Calculator/releases/tag/v1.0)
